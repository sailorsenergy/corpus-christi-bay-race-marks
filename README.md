# Corpus Chrisi Bay Race Marks
GPS coordinates for sailing race markers for the Corpus Christi Bay racing area.

## Source
These mark coordinates were found on the Corpus Christi Midget Ocean Racing Fleet website in this [handy PDF](https://ccmorf.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/2-1-10-ccyc-bay-race-map-and-chart.pdf)(downloaded 2015-07-17) that lists distance and bearing for all combinations of the different race marks.

The idea for this repository came from Norber Kiesel's GitHub repository for San Francisco Bay race marks, which he's been keeping up to date for several years.
